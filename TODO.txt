@todo Compiler should directory walk to build the object table (one file = one object)

#   Main.vape
# - Lib/
#     Game.vape
#     Networking.vape
#     Player.vape
#   - Rooms/
#       MainRoom.vape

The above directory structure will namespace these object files accordingly:

- Main
- Lib.Game
- Lib.Networking
- Lib.Player
- Lib.Rooms.MainRoom

first version: should not expose directories as objects
next iteration: directories should be treated as objects.

-> new Lib.Game()
-> Lib.files()

@todo Make objects their own process.

Send messages to execute object functions. (ex: like simplified genservers)

[object 1] - - - - {:function_call, FUNCTION_IDENTIFIER, [arguments]} - - - -> [object 2]
